# My Portfolio

Hi I'm Rayan, a web/software developer. I started coding in the beginning of 2020 right before the pandemic. 
I started with python and it was pretty hard knowing what to learn at that time so I initally started with the basics. 
Syntax, loops, arrays, dictionary, and etc.
Later on I realized that I was not making progress and I decided to go to a coding bootcamp to learn how to code. 
I had the chance to have a really good instructor, who had a lot of experience in programming.


In the bootcamp I've learned how to build an app from frontend to the backend, optimizing apps, deploy and maintain apps.
